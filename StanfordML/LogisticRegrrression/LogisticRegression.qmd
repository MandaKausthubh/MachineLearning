# Logistic Regression 

## What is Logistic Regression ?

It is something that is similar to a Classification Problem. It tells us some kind of "Probabilistic" representation of an event with binary outcomes, each represented as {0 or 1}.

### Mathematical Explanation.
We have our parameter $θ$ which is our vector (n+1 dimensional, where n is the number of parameters).
Our data is of the form {$x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$}, where x is an n-dimensional vector of parameter values and y is 0 or 1.

Our prediction model is based on the sigmoid function.
$$
P(y=1 | x;θ) = h_θ (x) = \frac {1} {1 + e^{θ^Tx}} = g(θ^Tx)
$$

Now we have the following:

$$
P(y | x;θ) = P(1 | x;θ) ^y .P(1 - y | x;θ) ^{(1-y)} = (h_\theta(x))^y.(1-h_\theta(x))^{(1-y)}
$$
