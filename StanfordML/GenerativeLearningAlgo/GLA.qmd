# Generative Learning Algorithm

We have two kinds of classification algorithms:

- **Discriminative Learning Problems** : Algorithms that either try to find the mapping or some kind of probability distribution of for the solution of y based on the input x.

- **Generative Algorithms**: Algorithms that try to find $p(x\ |\ y)$. This means that we are intending to find the set of features that are based on a given outbook.
