# Generalized Linear Models

## The Exponetitial Class of Probability Distributions

To work with GLMs we first need to explore the Exponetitial Class of Probability distributions.
$$
P(y;n) =  b(y)\ \text{exp}(η^T T(y) - a(η))
$$

Here we have:

- $T(y)$ the suffiecient statistical parameter. (This is our target function)
- $η$ is the natural parameter.
- $a(η)$ is the partition function. (This is there purely to normalize the integeral)

Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions are examples of Exponetitial family of distributions.
Other distributions that are also a part of this class are Multinomial class, Poisson, Gamma, Beta and the Dirchelet Class.

## Constructing GLMs

1. $y\ | x;θ\ \sim \ \text{ExponetialFamily}(\eta)$
2. Our goal is to predict the value of $T(y)$ given a value of $x$.
3. The natural parameter is linearly related to x, $η = θ^T x$
